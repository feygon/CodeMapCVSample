# CodeMapCVSample
A sample release of CodeMap

Contained in the zip file, please find a code sample of an preprocess program which takes 3 CSV input files and puts them into document objects, for them to be cross-indexed by unique keys and output to an XML file.

Update 7/14/2020: Builds, populates a boilerplate DataSet object from 3 different configurations of CSV files. Does not yet output an xml file. SQL input profile is included, but without a database security profile, using hard-coded meaningless credentials. (It is highly recommended that you replace this with SSOAuth or another non-hard-coded credentials -- these boilerplate credentials are provided only so it will build properly!)

Code map is under construction.

Version History:
Update 5/14/2020: Builds, and is well documented, but that it does not yet output an xml file, as of 5/14/2020, because the ADO.net calls have not yet been input to accomplish the document cross-indexing.

The code map demonstrates strong command of inheritance from virtual classes and a sensible use of interfaces, as well as thorough XML summary documentation.
